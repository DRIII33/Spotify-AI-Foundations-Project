# Portfolio Project: Evaluating Next-Gen "AI-Powered Smart Shuffle" at Spotify

## Project Overview

This project simulates a data science initiative for the Spotify AI Foundations team. The goal is to design and execute a robust evaluation framework for a new generative AI feature, tentatively named "GenShuffle." This feature expands on the existing "Smart Shuffle" by integrating personalized, AI-generated commentary and contextual narratives between tracks.

The core challenge is to go beyond traditional engagement metrics and assess the new model's performance on qualitative aspects like commentary quality, user discovery, and overall user satisfaction. The project will follow a data science lifecycle framework tailored for AI product evaluation, demonstrating proficiency in data engineering, causal inference, and data-driven storytelling.

## Project Goals

* **Objective:** Quantify the impact of the new "GenShuffle" feature on user behavior and evaluate the quality of its AI-generated commentary.
* **Methodology:** Utilize a hybrid evaluation approach combining user behavior analysis with advanced techniques like causal inference and LLM-as-a-judge methodologies.

## Key Success Metrics

**1. User Engagement Metrics:**
* **Stream Duration:** Measure the average time a user spends listening to tracks within a "GenShuffle" session. A successful model would increase this metric.
* **Skip Rate:** Analyze the frequency of track skips. A successful model should maintain or decrease the skip rate, indicating higher-quality recommendations.
* **Conversation Interaction Rate:** A new metric tracking explicit user feedback on AI commentary (e.g., "thumbs up" or "thumbs down"). A higher rate suggests the commentary is engaging.
* **Library Saves:** Track the number of tracks saved to a user's library from a "GenShuffle" session, indicating successful music discovery.

**2. AI Quality Metrics:**
* **Coherence Score:** A qualitative measure (simulated via `LLM-as-a-Judge`) of how well the AI commentary aligns with the music and the user's listening context.
* **Safety Flag Rate:** A metric to monitor the occurrence of flagged or inappropriate AI-generated content, essential for brand and user safety.
* **Novelty Score:** A measure of how many new-to-the-user artists or tracks are successfully introduced by the "GenShuffle" feature.
