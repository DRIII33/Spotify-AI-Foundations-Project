# Final Project Report: "GenShuffle" Impact Assessment

## Executive Summary

This project successfully designed and executed an end-to-end evaluation of Spotify's new "GenShuffle" generative AI feature. Our analysis, which combined a causal inference approach with qualitative model evaluation, yielded two core findings:

1.  **Increased User Engagement:** A simulated causal study demonstrated that the "GenShuffle" feature led to a statistically significant increase in average stream duration among users. This quantifies the feature's positive impact on user retention and platform value.
2.  **Validated AI Quality:** A comparison of human and simulated LLM ratings for AI commentary showed a high correlation, validating an "LLM-as-a-Judge" methodology. This enables the team to scale automated quality control and maintain high standards for the AI's output.

## Key Recommendations

* **Proceed with Wider Rollout:** Given the measurable positive impact on engagement, we recommend a wider rollout of the "GenShuffle" feature to new user segments.
* **Automate Quality Control:** Implement the validated LLM evaluation methodology into a production pipeline to efficiently monitor and flag low-quality or unsafe commentary.
* **Investigate Secondary Metrics:** Conduct further analysis to understand the feature's impact on skip rates and music discovery metrics, using the established evaluation framework.
